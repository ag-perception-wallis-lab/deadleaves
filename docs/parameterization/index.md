# Parameterization

The `dead_leaves` package provides two main classes which can be used to generate various images.

The first class `DeadLeavesModel` is used to sample the geometric shapes (objects) and generate the partition of the image through layering theses objects.
The second class `DeadLeavesImage` adds color and texture to each object.
